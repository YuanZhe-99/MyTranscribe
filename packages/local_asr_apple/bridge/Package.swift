// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// Purpose: The Neural Engine bridge: FluidAudio behind five C functions, as
// one dynamic library the app binds from Dart.
// Inputs: FluidAudio, pinned by exact version.
// Returns: The `LasrApple` dynamic library product.
// Side effects: None; SwiftPM resolves and builds it.
// Notes: Built only by `.github/workflows/native-prebuild.yml`, never in the
// app build (decision D21 of the local-models plan). The C interface is
// `lasr_apple.h` beside this file.
